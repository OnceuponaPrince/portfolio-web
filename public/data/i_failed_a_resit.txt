Title: I Failed A Resit

Body: I never expected to fail a resit. I was supposed to be the smart one. I had been riding high off the completion and grade of Information Systems and Databases, a module I though I would fail, but managed to knock out of the park. I was feeling like for the first time, I was in control of my university journey that after all those attempts, I would be able to move passed the first year; an insurmountable hurdle that blocked me for almost 10 years. After sleepless nights and unhealthy amounts of taurine, I sent off a site that I was honestly somewhat proud of, I was happy with it. I was shocked to receive a 20, the lowest score I’ve ever gotten in my life. I failed. I wanted to give up.

But I’m going to try one more time, and I hope it works.
