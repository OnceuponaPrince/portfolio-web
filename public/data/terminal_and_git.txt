Title: Terminal and Git

Body: I have never really used terminal before, though I know it is an integral tool in any developers arsenal. The lack of a GUI and the required knowledge of commands makes it a hefty task to complete. However, I managed to use the terminal to create my portfolio files, install dependencies and send it to a repository on Github.

Github is also very well-known for developers, so it was necessary that I start using it to build work experience for future jobs. Here are some of the commands that I learnt:

mkdir - creates a new folder

cd .. - takes you one level higher in your directory

cd~ - takes you to the highest level in your directory

git init - initialises an empty git repository for your local system

npm init - initialises a node.js project

npm install - installs dependencies for your project

git add . - prepares all untracked files for a git commit

Now that I have learnt them, it all seems so simple.
