Title: Autism, ADHD and other superpowers

Body: Hi, I have ADHD. This isn’t a some way for me to get your sympathy. People have a misunderstanding of ADHD, but what it means is that sometimes I’ll be doing something important and then suddenly I just… Hi, I have ADHD.

When I started comedy, this was the first joke that I ever wrote. It got a lot of laughs that night and every following night that I performed that bit.

I never really understood what it meant to have a learning difference. I had gone through most of my life believing that I was in control of my decisions and my actions. If I failed, I was the problem. If I couldn’t grasp something, I was just too dumb. 

In late 2020, I got my first assessment and it opened my eyes to a whole new world of understanding. Previously held notions of being broken or being not enough were replaced with new ideologies. My lack of knowledge had caused me to be operating on hard-mode non-stop. 

Suddenly, I could understand why I couldn’t think in the way most people did. I could understand why my perception and the way I processed information was the way it was.

With proper support, medication and mentoring I could change my life. 

But, this was just the beginning. Through further assessments and further education I learnt that I also have Dyspraxia, Autism, Dyslexia and a mild form of Epilepsy exacerbated by hypoglycaemia. 

On paper, I shouldn’t be achieving the way that I should. Though I didn’t know it, these differences had allowed me to live a life that my brain had been tailoring for me. My world had become my oyster. There are still setbacks and difficulties but I’m reminded of the all too famous Spider-Man quote.

“With great power comes great responsibility.”

I need to be aware of what I need to take care of myself, then think of how I can turn those into my strengths.

My ADHD, Autism, Dyspraxia and other conditions are my superpowers.
