### Local testing (Desktop only)
Follow this guide to install [Node Package Manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/install) to your terminal. When this is done, download this repository and unzip. In your terminal, change the directory to the unzipped folder. Run `npm start`. This will make the site accessible at http://localhost:9001/ .
### Issues
The website may not work if an application is already running on port 9001. [This](https://community.talend.com/s/article/How-to-find-and-kill-a-process-running-on-a-port-LVJkZ?language=en_US) is one of many freely available guides on clearing a given port. If all else fails, restart your device.
